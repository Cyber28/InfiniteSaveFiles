# Infinite Save Files

Are 3 save files not enough? How about infinite?

## Features

- Lets you create up to 2,147,483,648 save files

## Installation (manual)

You need the [pre-configured BepInEx pack](https://stacklands.thunderstore.io/package/BepInEx/BepInExPack_Stacklands) for this mod. If you installed BepInEx from a different place, you will need to edit the config files.

Extract the contents of this folder to `Stacklands/BepInEx/plugins/InfiniteSaveFiles`. The final folder layout should look like this:
```
plugins/
  InfiniteSaveFiles/
    InfiniteSaveFiles.dll
    icon.png
    manifest.json
    README.md
```

## Troubleshooting

This mod affects your save files minimally, it only changes the file name and the save id, both of which are easy to modify manually if something goes wrong
